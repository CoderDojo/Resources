These Session plans are only a rough guideline to the way you introduce topics. The best way to operate the courses is to sometimes follow the directions of the kids themselves as it tends to engage there interests more and make programming seem useful and cool. You may also want to get feedback from the kids and see what they want to learn allowing them to develop skills in areas they are interested in and show them different things they can do.
