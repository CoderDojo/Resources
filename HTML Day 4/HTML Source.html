<h4>Its time to add some nice UI touches!</h4>

<div id="smallBox">
	Lets start off with a simple box.<br />
	Nothing to fancy just some tesxt inside a little div of ours.<br />
	We've got a nice border going on stayed with the white background fairly standard affair.<br />
	Now try putting the mouse over me.<br />
	<h1>Thats a little more room!</h1>
	Note how the absolute positioning makes the div grow in size in a different direction
	For getting this far you get a special prize!

</div>

<div id="mediumBox">
	We can also do some fun things such as add a scrollbar to the div or allow it to be resized. Check out this div with its fancy pants scroll bar going down the side.

<h3> you should spend most of this session messing around with different div style things such as the positioning and such.</h3>
